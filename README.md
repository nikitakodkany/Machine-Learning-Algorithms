# MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS
This repository contains most of the supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms using plain Numpy and Matplotlib from scratch.

  - You can implement script on Jyupter Notebook [or]
  - Implement it on your personal computer on an IDE or Text Editor preferably.
  
  ## Algorithms
  1. **KMeans Clustering**
  On the Iris Dataset
  2. **KNN (K Nearest Neighbours)**
   On the Iris Dataset
  3. **SVM (Support Vector Machines)**
  On Breast Cancer Dataset
  4. **PCA (Principle Component Analysis)**
  On Iris Dataset and Wine Dataset
  5. **Linear Regression**
  On Boston Housing Price
